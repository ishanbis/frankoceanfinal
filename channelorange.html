        <p>In 2012, Frank Ocean released his long-awaited debut album, Channel Orange. It was created in tandem with producer Malay, and had a goal of moving away from sample-heavy projects to in-house production. The record has appearances from music heavyweights such as Pharrell, Andre 3000, Earl Sweatshirt, and John Mayer. The record was met with critical acclaim, with tracks such as Thinkin Bout You and Pyramids have become established as quintassential modern R&B tracks.</p>
        <p>The album went on to become the highest rated album of 2012, and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2013 Grammys. It went on to win best urban contemporary album, and became established as one of the best albums ever. The usage of funk melodies with synth experimentation was unlike anything before seen, and made clear that Ocean is both a phenomenal writer and musician.</p>
