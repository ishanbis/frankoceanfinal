            <p>In 2012, Frank Ocean released his long-awaited debut album, <i>Channel Orange</i> (styled <i>channel ORANGE</i>). It was created in tandem with producer Malay, and had a goal of moving away from sample-heavy projects to in-house production. The record has appearances from music heavyweights such as Pharrell, Andre 3000, Earl Sweatshirt, and John Mayer. The record was met with critical acclaim, with tracks such as Thinkin Bout You and Pyramids have become established as quintassential modern R&B tracks.</p>
            <p>The album went on to become the highest rated album of 2012, and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2013 Grammys. It went on to win best urban contemporary album, and became established as one of the best albums ever. The usage of funk melodies with synth experimentation was unlike anything before seen, and made clear that Ocean is both a phenomenal writer and musician.</p>

            <p>"PINK MATTER" is the 15th track on Channel Orange. It features a verse from greatly acclaimed Outkast rapper Andre 3000. The motif of "pink matter" serves as a representation of the female anatomy as well as lust and desire. It is also a play on the term "gray matter", which is what makes up the brain. This song creates a dichotomy between the clouding feeling of pleasure and lust vs. practicality and reality. The first verse on the song is sung by Ocean as he struggles over choosing pleasure while still feeling thoughts of guilt in his brain. The verse builds up into a vocal run from Ocean where he sings <i>"My God, giving me pleasure... pleasure over matter"</i> which signifies the choice of carnal pleasure or "pink matter" over practicality or "grey matter". After an instrumental interlude, the second half of the song is finished by Andre 3000. His verse details the consequences and fall out of choosing pleasure over practicality. He raps about missing his love and even having "withdrawls" from them. Clearly he's reminiscing on their relationship and longing to be with this person again. The outro of the song starts with <br><i>"You're good at being bad, you're bad at being good / For heaven's sakes, go to hell, nah, knock on wood"</i></br> In closing out the song, Andre is almost bitter with but then ends the line with "knock on wood", showing that even if he holds some resentment towards his love for leaving, he also truly wouldn't wish harm upon them.</p>
